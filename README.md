MVA Scripts, by Brian Pollack
=================================================
 
This repo was creatred from a subdirectory in HZG_Analyzer.  The MVA tools grew more complex and less
dependent on the actual analyzer. All tools use TMVA and some of the TMVA scripts and GUIs, along with my
own additions and optimizations.
 
Notes:
------
  * Currently the ROOT cannot be set to batch mode when running the combinatoric optimizer.
